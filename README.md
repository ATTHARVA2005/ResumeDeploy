## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation (Local Development)

Follow these steps to get ResumeRank running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ResumeRank # Or your project's root directory name
    ```

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **Windows:** `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    * **macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure your `requirements.txt` is up-to-date (it should contain all listed dependencies in the "Technology Stack" section).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project (same level as `run.py`).
    * Add your Gemini API Key and a strong secret key for JWT:
        ```dotenv
        GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'
        SECRET_KEY='a_very_strong_random_secret_key_for_jwt_signing'
        # DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///./resume_screening.db' # Optional: Default is SQLite, no need to set unless you want to be explicit
        ```
    * Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` and `a_very_strong_random_secret_key_for_jwt_signing` with your actual keys.

6.  **Initialize Database:**
    Your application uses SQLAlchemy, and by default, it will create an SQLite database file (`resume_screening.db`) in your project root.
    * **Important:** If you've run the app before and made database schema changes (e.g., adding/removing columns for education fields), you **must delete** any existing `resume_screening.db` file before running the app again to ensure the new schema is applied.

7.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
    You should see output indicating that Uvicorn is running, typically on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

8.  **Access in Browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.
