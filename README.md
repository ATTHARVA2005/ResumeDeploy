Say goodbye to manual resume screening and hello to efficient, data-driven hiring!

‚ú® Key Features

ResumeRank offers a comprehensive suite of features to streamline your recruitment workflow:

üß† AI-Powered Resume Analysis:
* **Intelligent Extraction**: Utilizes the Google Gemini API to deeply analyze uploaded resumes (PDF, DOCX, TXT formats).
* **Structured Data Output**: Automatically extracts key information such as: Full Name, Email, Phone, LinkedIn/GitHub URLs, Total Years of Experience, Highest Education Level & Major, a comprehensive list of Extracted Skills, and detailed Work Experience entries (Title, Company, Dates, Description).
* **Accuracy & Efficiency**: Reduces human error and significantly speeds up the resume review process by providing structured insights.

üìã AI-Powered Job Description Analysis:
* **Effortless Input**: Add job descriptions either by pasting the full text or by providing a URL to a job posting. ResumeRank will automatically fetch the content from the URL, intelligently extract all critical requirements, and pre-fill the form for your review.
* **Key Data Points**: Extracts: Required Experience (Years), Required Skills, Required Certifications, Required Education Level & Major.
* **Simplified Workflow**: Eliminates the need for manual entry of individual requirements, allowing users to focus on the job details.

üéØ Intelligent Matching Algorithm:
* **Comprehensive Scoring**: Calculates a quantifiable match score between a resume and a job description based on multiple weighted criteria:
    * **Skills Alignment**: Compares extracted skills using exact, fuzzy, and semantic matching (TF-IDF cosine similarity).
    * **Experience Matching**: Evaluates if the candidate's years of experience meet the job's requirements.
    * **Certifications Matching**: Identifies alignment with required professional certifications.
    * **Education Matching**: Compares highest education level and academic major, intelligently handling specializations (e.g., "Computer Science (AI)" matches "Computer Science").
* **Customizable Ranking**: Users can adjust the weight of each criterion (Skills, Experience, Certifications, Education) to tailor match results to their specific hiring priorities.
* **Unbiased Results**: Provides objective scores to help mitigate unconscious bias in candidate selection.
* **Detailed Breakdown**: Offers insights into matched, missing, and additional skills, along with individual scores for experience, certifications, and education.

üîê Secure User Authentication:
* **Seamless Onboarding**: Supports user registration and login with secure password hashing.
* **Admin Access**: A separate, secure login portal is available for administrators to access the admin panel.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation (Local Development)

Follow these steps to get ResumeRank running on your local machine:
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/ATTHARVA2005/ResumeDeploy.git](https://github.com/ATTHARVA2005/ResumeDeploy.git)
    cd ResumeDeploy
    ```
2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment**:
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    * Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    * macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4.  **Install Dependencies**: Ensure your `requirements.txt` is up-to-date (it should contain all listed dependencies in the "Technology Stack" section).
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.
    * Add your environment variables to this file:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'
        SECRET_KEY='a_very_strong_random_secret_key_for_jwt_signing'
        DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///./resume_screening.db'
        ADMIN_EMAIL='your_admin_email@example.com'
        ADMIN_PASSWORD='your_strong_admin_password'
        ```
    * Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys and desired admin credentials.
6.  **Initialize Database**:
    * Your application uses SQLAlchemy and by default with the above `DATABASE_URL`, it will create an SQLite database file.
    * **Important**: If you have an old database file from a previous schema, you **must delete it** before running the app again to apply the latest schema changes.
7.  **Run the Application**:
    ```
    python run.py
    ```
    You should see output indicating that Uvicorn is running, typically on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.
8.  **Access in Browser**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.
